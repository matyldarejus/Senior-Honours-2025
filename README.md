# Senior-Honours-2025
All the code I needed to carry out my senior honours project 'Finding the Missing Baryons with NASA's Next Generation Telescope' supervised by Prof Romeel Dave at the University of Edinburgh. 

Environment in which the code was tested out to run best: 

'sh_env'
python=3.9 yt=4.2.1 matplotlib=3.4.3 numpy=1.22 scipy=1.9

This repository is based on code originally developed by Sarah Appleby as part of her PhD project under the supervision of Romeel Dave at The University of Edinburgh.  
The original version can be found [here](https://github.com/sarahappleby/cgm/tree/master/absorption/ml_project).  

This fork has been adapted by Matylda Rejus for use in the 2025 Senior Honours project, including:
- Adjustments to file paths and arguments for compatibility with local cluster environments.
- Planned refactoring to remove hardcoded parameters and generalize the analysis pipeline.
